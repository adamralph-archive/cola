# Cola

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/adamralph/cola/total.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/adamralph/cola/releases/latest) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/547859x8db8aheoq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adamralph/cola/branch/master)

A portable command line runner for files created using the brilliant [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net/), all in a single exe!

### Getting started

1. The Cola requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later.
2. Download [cola.exe](https://github.com/adamralph/cola/releases/latest).
3. (Optional) add the folder containing cola.exe to your PATH.

Cola currently supports a small subset of the features of [lprun.exe](https://www.linqpad.net/lprun.aspx). New features are being added all the time. If something you need isn't supported, please raise an issue or a pull request! (No pull request is too small.)
